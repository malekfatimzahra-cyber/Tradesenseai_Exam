                    "content_markdown": "# What is a Financial Market?\n\n## 1) Concept (Definition)\n\n- A financial market is a **decentralized auction system** where buyers and sellers meet to exchange assets at agreed prices\n- Unlike retail stores with fixed prices, market prices fluctuate based on **supply and demand** in real-time\n- Markets operate through **order books** that match buy orders (bids) with sell orders (asks)\n- **Liquidity providers** (banks, institutions) ensure there's always someone to trade with\n- Markets can be **centralized** (exchanges like NYSE) or **decentralized** (Forex, OTC)\n\n## 2) Why it Matters (Trader Perspective)\n\n- Understanding market structure helps you **identify who moves prices** (retail vs institutions)\n- Knowing market participants helps you **avoid being liquidity** for larger players\n- Recognizing auction dynamics explains why prices **gap, spike, or consolidate**\n- Market mechanics determine **execution quality** (slippage, fills, rejections)\n\n## 3) Example (Concrete Scenario)\n\n**Scenario:** EUR/USD at 1.1000\n- **Retail trader** wants to buy 0.1 lot (10,000 units)\n- **Market maker** (bank) provides liquidity by offering to sell at 1.1002 (Ask)\n- Trader pays the **2 pip spread** as the cost of instant execution\n- Behind the scenes: The bank aggregates thousands of small retail orders to offset risk with institutional counterparties\n\n## 4) Common Mistakes\n\n- **Thinking markets are random** - They follow auction logic and order flow\n- **Ignoring who's on the other side** - Every trade has a counterparty with opposite intent\n- **Trading during low liquidity** - Wide spreads and erratic price action\n- **Not understanding broker business model** - Market makers profit from your spread, not necessarily your loss\n- **Confusing price movement with market direction** - Noise vs signal\n\n## 5) Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Identify if your broker is a market maker or ECN\n- [ ] Check typical spread for your trading pair during your session\n- [ ] Understand who provides liquidity in your market (banks, institutions, retail)\n- [ ] Know the difference between centralized and decentralized markets\n- [ ] Recognize that price = last agreed transaction between buyer and seller\n\n## 6) Mini Exercise (Do it Now)\n\nOpen your trading platform and observe the order book (if available) or price ladder:\n- Watch how Bid and Ask prices change in real-time\n- Note the **spread width** during different times of day\n- Identify a moment when spread **widens** (usually during news or session gaps)\n- Write down: \"I understand that I pay the spread every time I enter a trade\""

                    "content_markdown": "# Bid, Ask & Spread\n\n## 1) Concept (Definition)\n\n- **Bid** = The highest price a buyer is willing to pay right now (you SELL at this price)\n- **Ask (Offer)** = The lowest price a seller is willing to accept (you BUY at this price)\n- **Spread** = Ask - Bid (the difference between the two prices)\n- The spread is the **transaction cost** you pay to enter a trade instantly\n- Spread width varies by **liquidity, volatility, and session**\n\n## 2) Why it Matters (Trader Perspective)\n\n- You start every trade **in the red** by the amount of the spread\n- Wide spreads eat into profits, especially for **scalpers and day traders**\n- Spread widens during **news events, low liquidity, and session transitions**\n- Understanding spread helps you **choose optimal entry times** (tight spread = lower cost)\n- Spread is how **market makers and brokers profit** from facilitating your trades\n\n## 3) Example (Concrete Scenario)\n\n**EUR/USD Example:**\n- Bid: 1.10000\n- Ask: 1.10020\n- Spread: 2 pips (0.00020)\n\n**If you BUY at 1.10020:**\n- You can immediately SELL at 1.10000 (the current Bid)\n- Instant loss: 2 pips = $2 per 0.1 lot\n- Price must move UP by 2 pips just to **break even**\n\n**During London Open (high liquidity):**\n- Spread might be 0.5-1 pip\n\n**During Asian session (low liquidity):**\n- Spread might widen to 3-5 pips\n\n## 4) Common Mistakes\n\n- **Ignoring spread when calculating risk/reward** - A 2-pip spread on a 10-pip target is 20% of your profit\n- **Trading during wide spread periods** - Entering during news or low liquidity sessions\n- **Not comparing broker spreads** - Some brokers charge 3x more than others\n- **Thinking Bid/Ask is the \"real price\"** - There's no single price, only the last transaction\n- **Forgetting spread doubles your cost** - You pay it on entry AND exit\n\n## 5) Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Always check current spread before entering a trade\n- [ ] Avoid trading 30 minutes before/after major news (spread spikes)\n- [ ] Compare your broker's spread to industry averages\n- [ ] Factor spread into your risk/reward calculation\n- [ ] Understand: Tighter spread = lower transaction cost\n\n## 6) Mini Exercise (Do it Now)\n\n**Task:** Open your platform and measure the spread:\n1. Note the Bid and Ask for EUR/USD right now\n2. Calculate: Ask - Bid = Spread in pips\n3. Multiply spread by your typical position size to find **cost per trade**\n4. Check the same pair during London open vs Asian session - compare spreads\n5. Write down: \"I will avoid trading when spread is wider than [X] pips\""

Place a **Buy Limit** 10 pips below current price\n2. Place a **Sell Limit** 10 pips above current price\n3. Observe which one fills first (if any)\n4. Cancel unfilled orders\n5.

Account balance: $1,000\n2. Risk per trade: 1% = $10\n3. Entry: 1.1000, SL: 1.0980 (20 pips)\n4. Calculate lot size: $10 risk ÷ 20 pips ÷ $1/pip = 0.05 lot\n5.

Find a candle with a **long upper wick** - What happened? (Rejection)\n2. Find a candle with a **long lower wick** - What happened? (Support/buying)\n3. Find a candle with a **large body** - Strong move in that direction\n4. Find a **Doji** (open = close, small body) - Indecision\n5. Write down: \"Wicks tell me where price was rejected\""

Open **Daily chart** - Is price trending up, down, or ranging?\n2. Open **4-Hour chart** - Where is the nearest support/resistance?\n3.
